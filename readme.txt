The included files comprise the complete source code of JA2 (as provided on the JA2:Wildfire CD) and additional files made by me to enable out-of-the-box compilation. This source code is for educational purposes only (read the included license for more info).  Please note that you'll need a copy of MS VS6.0 to build it painlessly.

How to:

1: Extract the included files
2: Copy the "ja2" and "Standard Gaming Platform" directories into c:\ 
3: Set up the include directories in VC6 to include the Build directory as well as subdirectories, and the "Standard Gaming Platform" on the list
4: Include the "Standard Gaming Platform" path in the library paths
5: Go to Build->Set Active Configurations and chose Win32 ja2.exe release
6: Build the projects (press "Build ja2.exe")
7: Wait for 5 minutes, serve when ready

Please note that it's preferable to open the source by opening the workspace in the Build directory
